# House Price Prediction

This project involves cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, training, and predicting house prices using a given dataset. We use various regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression, to build and fine-tune the model.

Installation

    Clone the repository or download the project files.
    Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6+).
    Install the required libraries using pip:

bash

pip install pandas scikit-learn

Usage

    Place your dataset file (house.csv) in the project directory.
    Run the script to clean, preprocess, and train the model:

bash

python DEP task 2

    If you have new data for which you want to make predictions, place the new dataset file in the project directory and update the new_data_path variable in the script accordingly.

Dataset

downloaded from kaggle


Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps are performed:

    Handling Missing Values:
        Numerical columns are filled with the median value.
        Categorical columns are filled with the mode value.

    Data Type Conversion:
        Convert relevant columns to appropriate data types.

    Removing Duplicates:
        Duplicate rows are removed.

    Feature Engineering:
        A new feature TotalArea is created by converting area size based on area type.

    Label Encoding:
        Categorical variables are label encoded to convert them into numerical values.

    Normalization/Scaling:
        Numerical features are normalized/scaled using StandardScaler.

Feature Engineering

    Polynomial Features:
        Polynomial features are added to capture non-linear relationships.

Model Training 

The following models are used for training:

    Linear Regression:
        Base linear regression model.


Making Predictions

The script is designed to load new data, preprocess it, and make predictions using the best-performing model. The predictions are saved to a CSV file (predicted_prices.csv).
Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

    Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors.
    R-squared (R2): Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

The best model is selected based on the highest R2 score on the test set.
